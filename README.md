# Phishing-Website-Detector
### Current State of Project
- uses the scikit-learn library to train a logistic regression model that detects phishing websites 
- achieves precision, recall, and f1-score greater than 0.90

### Further Improvement/Enhancement
- use the current dataset to train other models that may achieve greater precision, recall, and f1-score
- make the current program accesible and useable by creating a browser extension that detects phishing websites based on the trained model
